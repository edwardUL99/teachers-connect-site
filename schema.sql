  Table 1 accounts
  Each user (admin, teacher, organisation) will need an account to sign in. This table stores an account for each user.
  An account stores the credentials for login. A profile is then added on top of an account (see profiles tables).
  There can be multiple entries with the same email since we allow a user sign up as an organisation and a teacher
  if they so wish. Username will always be unique however, and it cannot be null, so we will choose it as the primary key.
  created_at should revert to the default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
